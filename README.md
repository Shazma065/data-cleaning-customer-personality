# data-cleaning-customer-personality
For this assignment, I performed data cleaning and preprocessing on the Customer Personality Analysis dataset using Python (Pandas) in Google Colab. The raw dataset was obtained from Kaggle and loaded in Colab from a ZIP archive. 

I cleaned the Customer Personality Analysis dataset using Python in Google Colab. I handled missing values in the "Gender" column by replacing them with 'Unknown', removed 102 duplicate rows, and standardized text entries by converting gender values to lowercase. I also converted date columns to proper datetime format and renamed all columns to snake_case for consistency. Finally, I fixed data types and saved the cleaned dataset as cleaned_marketing_campaign.csv.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Google Colab: Cloud-based Python execution
Python: Main programming language
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning
Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb): Documenting and running the code
